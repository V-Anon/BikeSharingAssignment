# Bike Sharing Assignment
> Upgrad assignment investigating the Rental Bike Demand for the company BoomBikes.

## Summary
The factors that influence the demand of rental bikes is analysed using Linear Regression, and the significant variables and their influence are identified.

## Business Understanding
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits. So in this project the factors  affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market is analysed, significant variables that influence bike demand are identified and their influence is quantified and ranked.

## Conclusions
- The variables year, temperature, winter, and months March, April, May and September have a positive impact on the count of bike rentals.
- The variables wind speed, spring, Light Precipitation, Misty or Cloudy atmosphere have a negative impact on the count of bike rentals.
- Hence, bike demand will be high in the months of March, April, May and September especially when temperature is in the higher range and wind speed is low with, low probability of rain and snow as well as a misty or cloudy atmosphere. The demand will be higher in a winter weather compared to summer weather.
- Also, demand will increase in the upcoming years, compared to previous year.
